<a>Features:</a>
<ul>
<li> Designed for harsh industrial environments or outdoor applications (security, outdoor wireless, controls etc. etc.)</li><li> Ideally suited for mounting printed circuit boards, panels or DIN rail mounted components (see photo features for details).</li><li> Designed for wall mounting.  Interior is secure as lid screws are behind the lid. Can be made more secure if wall mounted with security screws (tamper resistant screws).</li><li> Satin texture finish with smooth recessed surface on lid for a membrane keypad or label</li><li> Standoffs molded in the interior of the lid &amp; enclosure - designed for #4 x 1/4” self tapping screws (our part number 1555TS100)</li><li> Choice of two materials:o General purpose ABS plastic (material carries a UL flammability rating of UL94 HB). Not recommended for outdoor use.o Polycarbonate (material carries a UL flammability rating of UL94 5VA @ 3mm) - Recommended for outdoor use.</li><li> Color is a light gray (RAL 7035) to help keep heat absorption down.</li><li> Gasketed lid with two piece “tongue &amp; groove” construction provides protection against access of oil, dust and water.</li><li> Gasket is one piece made from high temperature, U.L. listed silicone.  Supplied loose inside the enclosure (not pre-installed).</li><li> Designed to meet NEMA Type 4, 4X, 6, 6P, 12 &amp; 13 ratings which meet and exceed IP ratings up to and including IP68. </li><li> Polycarbonate version is UL 508A listed (File # E65324).</li><li> Flanged lid is secured with self captivating M4 stainless steel machine screws (included), threaded into integral stainless steel bushings for repetitive assembly &amp; disassembly</li><li> Internal features are maximized for mounting options</li>
