<p>
        Project template containing the recommended board layout for 1599TABS-BAT<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<a>Features:</a>
<ul>
<li> Low profile - ergonomically designed for a comfortable fit into the user’s hands.</li><li> Perfect for instrument or mobile data enclosures requiring a touch screen.</li><li> Molded from flame retardant ABS plastic, choice of black or grey.  Material carries a UL flammability rating of 94V-0.</li><li> Enclosure is assembled with six (6) - M3-0.5 x 18 mm Phillips machine screws, threaded into integral brass bushings. Perfect for applications when repetitive assembly and disassembly are required.</li><li> Integral brass bushings are factory inserted into the top half of the enclosure (see photos).</li><li> Lap joint construction provides protection against access of dust and splashing water. Designed to meet IP54.</li><li> P.C. board standoffs are molded into case top &amp; bottom halves (see drawings or photos for more details).</li><li> Battery door &amp; compartment version (part numbers ending in “BAT”) includes 8 battery clips (for 4 - AA batteries) and two 9 volt (PP3) battery clips.</li><li> Contains one end panel which is removable for easy modification.</li><li> Bottom half of enclosure includes a molded inlay for labels.</li>

        The "Dwgs.User" layer contains all critical dimmensions in milimeters[inches].<br/>
        The "Edge.Cuts" layer contains the maximum board outline and holes to align with board standoffs.<br/><br/>
