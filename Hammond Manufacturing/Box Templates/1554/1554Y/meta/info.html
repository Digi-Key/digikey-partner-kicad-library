<a>Features:</a>
<ul>
<li> Ideally suited for mounting printed circuit boards or DIN rail mounted components (see photo features below for details).</li><li> ABS Versions are molded from general purpose material which carries a flammability rating of UL94-HB.  For indoor use.</li><li> Polycarbonate versions are UV stabilized for outdoor use.  Gray polycarb carries a UL94-5VA rating, while clear and smoked lids carry a UL94V-0 rating.</li><li> Polycarbonate versions are cUL and UL 508A listed (File # E65324).  ABS plastic versions are not UL listed.</li><li> Enclosure color is a light gray (RAL 7035).</li><li> Gasketed lid with two piece “tongue &amp; groove” construction provides protection against access of oil, dust and water.</li><li> Replaceable gasket is one piece made from high temperature, U.L. listed silicone.  Supplied loose inside the enclosure (not pre-installed).</li><li> Polycarb versions are designed to meet NEMA Type 4, 4X, 6, 6P, 12 &amp; 13 ratings which meet and exceed IP ratings up to and including IP68.  (Except 1554/55 V size which is 4,4X only)</li><li> ABS Plastic versions are designed to meet IP66.</li><li> Lid is secured with included M4 stainless steel machine screws which are threaded into integral stainless steel bushings for repetitive assembly &amp; disassembly. All hardware is stainless steel to avoid corrosion caused by dissimilar metals. </li><li> Lid screws are self-captivating (lid holes are threaded with the first installation of lid screws)</li>
